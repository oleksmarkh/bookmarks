It's a personal list. You are welcome to reuse it, of course. But please follow the consistency rules:

1. When adding a new link, make sure it's ordered according to categorization described in the *legend* (also applies to sublists).
1. If a section is split into sublists and there are items that don't quite fit into any of those, they should be grouped under a *misc* sublist at the end of that section.

Thank you :)
